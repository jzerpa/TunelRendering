TunelRendering
==============

This is a project for my master degree in Computer Graphics. It renders an artery from a set of splines. It uses OpenGL and C++.

Aplication Controls:

Key	Function
a  - d	Rotation in y (Right and Left)	
e - r	Rotation in x (Up and Down)	
w - s	Zoom in - Zoom out	
v	Interactive Mode / Manual Control
n	Polygon Mode
m	Points Mode
b	Wireframe Mode - This mode is the more computational expensive. Use Carefully :)

Note: To exit the program, right click in the window and use the quit button.
