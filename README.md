TunelRendering
==============

This is a project for my master degree in Computer Graphics. It renders an artery from a set of splines. It uses OpenGL and C++.

Application Controls

**Key	Function**  

a  - d	Rotation in y (Right and Left)  	
e - r	Rotation in x (Up and Down)	  
w - s	Zoom in - Zoom out	  
v	Interactive Mode / Manual Control  
n	Polygon Mode
